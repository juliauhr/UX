    <strong class="pink">Client: </strong><br>The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI),

  <div class="hs"><h2>The Problem</h2></div><br>
  Solar and electric energy has to be stored in batteries.
  Usually, this is done by stacking batteries in shipping containers, called enclosures.
  Recently, there have been several serious fires at energy storage facilities.
  To reduce the danger to maintanence and operations workers at energy storage facilities,
  EPRI wants to design and prototype an <b>augmented reality</b> application
  to visually communicate safety-relevant data to on-site operators.
  <br><br>
  <div class="hs"><h2>Research</h2></div><br>
  I led ideation and <b>co-design sessions</b> with my team and representatives from the client organization.
  We defined overarching goals for the project and laid out scenarios where the app would be used.
  Based on the  made some sketches.

  Then I made a <b>storyboard</b> for one of the scenarios with <b>low fidelity wireframes</b> of the app.

  <br>
  We went on a <b>site visit</b> to a solar energy storage research facility in eastern Colorado
  where I took photos and videos and learned about the site and the operators who would use the app.
  Then I made <b>high-fidelity wireframes</b> and developed a <b>prototype</b> using <i>A-Frame</i> and <i>ar.js</i>.
  We went on a second site visit to test the prototype and made adjustments,
  like giving the text a background color so it can be seen in both light and dark conditions.
